This directory contains files for the implementation
of a sparse matrix in two ways:
 
 - SparseMatrixCSR :  Compressed sparse row format
 - SparseMatrixCOO :  Coordinate format

- SparseMatrix is an abstract class 
- SparseMatrixCOO & SparseMatrixCSR are derived classes

To compile everything, just launch the script "script.sh"
with the following command:

. script.sh

Then, to test the program, just write on the command line

./main 



The Main.cpp provides few examples of usage of the classes.
