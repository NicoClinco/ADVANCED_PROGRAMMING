<bold><underline>Python Modules:<bold>

 -Added a new directory "pyDirLib" in which you can find two directories

  for the statistics and quadrature module.


 -In /src/PyDirDF and /src/PyDirQuad you can find the files where

  the classes are converted from C++ to python.


 -In dataFrameBind.cpp and quadBind.cpp you can find the conversion

  from c++ to python
  Then, i have enhanced the functionalities directly in Python,
  by inheriting from the base class and creating an "enhanced" derived class
  for the data-frame module. See the docstring for further information.
